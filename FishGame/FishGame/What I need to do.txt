Find out if I can completely replace Game1 
and put it all in screen class OR use Game1
as the main Screen abstract class.

Test SplashScreen, MenuScreen and GameScreen 
with inputs, images, and sprites. 

Use Update function for each Screen child to
use static call of GameStateManager Instance
to switch between screens.

Create a hide/change function in GameStateManager
so we dont delete classes and create classes carelessly.
